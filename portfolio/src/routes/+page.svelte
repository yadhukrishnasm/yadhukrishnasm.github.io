		<p class="text-xl font-bold">About</p>
		<p>
			I'm a freelance developer with a focus on frontend development and full product workflows.
			I’ve built a complete POS system from scratch — from interface to architecture — and I'm
			preparing it for release. Outside of client work, I regularly solve algorithmic problems,
			explore system-level programming. I'm also experimenting with hardware projects — including a
			compact cyberdeck, and smart lighting devices. I’m drawn to minimal, functional design and
			enjoy working across both software and hardware to build useful tools.
